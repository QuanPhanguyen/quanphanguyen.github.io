> Do you want a fun (debatable) event to play with your friends with an annoying amount of set-up and execution? Watch people you like scurry around Berkeley campus in a scramble to get imaginary points and no reward? Or maybe you're new to the school and want a game to play while you explore the campus. Well, boy do I have something for you.
