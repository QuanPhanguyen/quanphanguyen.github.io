> You swarm around your favorite teacher for your final assigment of the semester.

***A dark sunsetting late afternoon, another end to an arduous three hours. Classes at the Arcane Elysium have always been difficult, but Professor Enee Nymfang and her small discussion groups are something else entirely. Working on spells collaboratively, messing around with what makes them tick in fast-talks, and interacting with others is fun but strenuous. But with classes nearing their end and your time together leaving just as soon, that’s not what’s on your mind. When the gong of the school bell chimes throughout the halls and the classrooms, you all stand listlessly, pondering over what to do.***

***“Come everyone, I have a final assignment for all of you.”***

Everyone loved me so much, I was able to convince my entire creative writing class to partake in a D&D one-shot. I am eternally grateful for this memory which will remain with me for the rest of my life.

This one-shot was an insane undertaking. With nearly a dozen players, this was one of my largest sessions yet. It can split into two segments: interacting with the classmates who couldn't make it through videos I had them prerecord for the session and a standard dungeon crawl. It also featured my first physical puzzle, where I hid a code with lemon juice on parchment. The session was a joyous four hours in my cramped college apartment, and it can certainly be run with any group.

Although the two video files have been lost to time, nine custom character sheets each with their own artwork created by one of the players and tons more assets can be found in the links below.
