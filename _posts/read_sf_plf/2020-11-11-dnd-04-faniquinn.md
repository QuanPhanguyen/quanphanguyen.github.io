> A fairy's mischief and magic envelops you during a nap. 

One-shot with an extremely quick turnaround of a few days while also being friendly enough to accomodate a new player. This was ran smoothly online multiple times with an average duration of two to three hours. A standard one-shot progression featuring a puzzle, a social event, and a boss fight.

Music composed by me for the puzzle. Boss fight introduces a new phase mechanic that I end up toying around with in future monster creations.
