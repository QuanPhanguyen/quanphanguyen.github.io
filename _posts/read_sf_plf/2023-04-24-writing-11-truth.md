<p align="center">

Fool’s uncertainty is what it devours.
An absolute. It can never have change
Too late may your own be lost, deflowered,
But after she remains the same exchange.

Law’s mistress convicts forward certainty.
It twists and changes to an absolute
Form. Unrefined a blossoming beauty
A soundless exchange, enigmatic, mute.

So take heed, for she sickens like a blight.
An unbearable burden, constant stress.
Propagating it is man’s greatest plight,
But many have waned, for many digress.

Know that in the end, it remains constant.
Fear or embrace it, impartialness reigns.
So wander, ever near, to ascendant
And lie, blissfully, in effervescent veins.
