> Darkness creeps as graverobbing a dark wizard goes askew.

A one-shot created for my close friends designed to run entirely online. Playtime was between 3-4 hours with five participants. Ran with a slightly modified ruleset of 5e D&D where hitpoints are replaced with Panic Points. Failed events grant one point, with three marking the characters death.

Custom character sheets with unique abilities designed by me for each friend.
