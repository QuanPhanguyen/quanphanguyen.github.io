> Darkness creeps as graverobbing a dark wizard goes askew.

A one-shot created for new and old players. It would be cool if this was run in-person, but online was the way we had to go. It's a beginner friendly adventure with creative fights and puzzles. Playtime was around 4 hours. 

Specially drawn assets were used for the puzzle segment in this, but it is entirely possible and recommended to draw your own. One boss statblock can be found below, with all three phases listed in the link.
