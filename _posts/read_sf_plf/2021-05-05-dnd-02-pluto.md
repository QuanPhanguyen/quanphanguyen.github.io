> Darkness creeps as graverobbing a dark wizard goes askew.

***Your party took a job to “investigate some very safe catacombs with an apprentice witch under the necromancy school :)”  Although the task sounded innocent enough, the pay for it was absurd to the point where you were skeptical of it’s safety. 200 gold pieces. For EACH of you. A letter back and a couple of days travel later, you find yourself at the meet-up location with the client already at the location. You bask in a large vantage of lush trees, a worn sun rapidly retreating from the night. Besides the girl in front of you, there is a stone mound covered with moss and vine. It’s obscured to a point beyond recognition of what it could be.***

A one-shot created for new and old players. It would be cool if this was run in-person, but online was the way we had to go. It's a beginner friendly adventure with creative fights and puzzles. Playtime was around 4 hours. 

Specially drawn assets were used for the puzzle segment in this, but it is entirely possible and recommended to draw your own. One boss statblock can be found below, with all three phases listed in the link.
