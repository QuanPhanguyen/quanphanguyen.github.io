> A story unfolds as friends reconnect after a long period of silence.

A one-shot created for my close friends designed to run entirely online. Playtime was between 3-4 hours with five participants. Ran with a slightly modified ruleset of 5e D&D where hitpoints are replaced with Panic Points. Failed events grant one point, with three marking the characters death.

Custom character sheets with unique abilities made by me for each friend. Specially edited original cassette tape files used in the one-shot can be found below.
