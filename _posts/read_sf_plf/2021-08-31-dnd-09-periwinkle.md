> A shady townsmember's black magic ensures disaster for everyone.

***Every dozen years, the rustic village Greenguard celebrates its great wine harvest, and it seems as if that time has come again. It’s an extremely celebratory event with party, laughter, and joy. Not to mention the free bottles of alcohol they give out for the entire weekend as long as you drink them alongside the townspeople. You’re in the area, locals recommended it, why not give it a shot? After all, it’ll only be three days...***

A one-shot created for no particular reason at all, just that the official campaigns have been slow and the players were itching for something. It features some very game-like puzzles and combat encounters, with only a slight emphasis on roleplay. Gameplay took four hours with a group of five experienced players.

There is one asset used for one of the puzzles in the adventure, created by one of my players.
