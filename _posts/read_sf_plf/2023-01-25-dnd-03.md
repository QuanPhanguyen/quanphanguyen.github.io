> Sirens blaze as all hell breaks loose in a prison above the clouds.

A one-shot designed for friends who wanted to get into tabletop gaming without understanding too much of the mechanical rules. This was run in person, taking a solid four hours with five players. Although hectic and fun, it ended up being much more mechanically challenging for players than initially expected. The players were still able to overcome it.

Commissioned artist for the artwork of the one-shot characters. Heavy emphasis on characters and roleplay, therefore each character has their own file with a full rundown of their backgrounds, personalities, and relationship charts with the other players. There is one unique boss monster block for this one-shot. Full excerpts and a personality quiz to see which character you would be linked below.

Prentiss has lived most of their life completely unaware that they’re different from others. No one around her suspected anything either, as she was so jolly and made the most out of what little she had that there were almost no warning signs of her disruptive side. However, the day finally came when they had nothing left to make something out of. So they turned to the people closest to her. Blood rained and flesh was torn. Prentiss is currently imprisoned for multiple life sentences for the massacre of hundreds of villagers and soldiers. She is currently 2 years into her sentence.

## [Wesley Brown](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRIwXgvxAD7dAE55AyYLv38GeCIQSttNQkO5yRGDBnPXy4F2Q7pn244FaEVnH0UudjghI7JEilhGIp0/pub) <!-- Link to full story -->

Wesley Brown was simply hit with an unfortunate stroke of bad luck in his youth. A Fiend rose up from the circles of Hell and needed a host to hide away from his pursuers. That host just happened to be Wesley. In a fight for control over his body that spanned the course of several days, numerous settlements were razed and countless more were killed. Ultimately, Wesley ended with slightly more control over his body than the Fiend. He was captured but knows that he’s a ticking time bomb with this thing still inside of him. Wesley wishes to get out as soon as possible and search for a way to split himself wholly again. He is currently in the 4th year of his multiple life sentences.
