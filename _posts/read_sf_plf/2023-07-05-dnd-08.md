> A random configuration of suspects, methods, and locations. One true ending.

This was a submission for my class regarding the genre of Fantasy. As such, it is formatted in a more official way. Despite it's sleek appearance, it's one of the most difficult one-shots to run entirely due to its lack of content. There are 6x6x6 different outcomes for this one-shot, and the DM must design whichever one they get. This is not recommended for new players. I have not run this yet.

This one-shot serves more as a tale than a game, with players vying against each other while also trying to discover the real ending of the game. A snippet of the one-shot will be shown below, alongside all of the detective character sheets.
