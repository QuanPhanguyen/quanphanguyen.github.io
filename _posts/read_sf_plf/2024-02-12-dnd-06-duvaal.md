> The princess will do anything to ensure the wedding goes perfectly. Anything.

***It’s been over a year since you’ve last seen Lapine, though that hasn’t stopped her from regaling you with her delusional tales of wonder. Well, delusional to anyone other than you all, since you’ve been keeping Alice’s secret. Over a series of ramping, passionate letters, you collectively let out a sigh of relief when their relationship went public.***

***Just three months later, you awaken to find an invitation in the mail. It’s an RSVP for their wedding, happening this weekend! Alongside all of the cordial information, there is a note scribbled on the back of the envelope.***

Lapine and Alice are back by popular demand. It was hastily made without much preparation, and ran for three different groups. Sticking with the Valentine's day nature, this was run in-person. Similar to the previous one-shot in this series, players act more as side characters affecting the main, linear plot. This time they get to know Alice better. Playtime is short, at just under 3 hours.

I commissioned one of the players to create a custom wedding invite to act as a teaser for the upcoming game, seen in the header.
