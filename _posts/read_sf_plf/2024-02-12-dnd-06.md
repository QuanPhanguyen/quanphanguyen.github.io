> The princess will do anything to ensure the wedding goes perfectly. Anything.

Lapine and Alice are back by popular demand. It was hastily made without much preparation, and ran for three different groups. Sticking with the Valentine's day nature, this was run in-person. Similar to the previous one-shot in this series, players act more as side characters affecting the main, linear plot. This time they get to know Alice better. Playtime is short, at just under 3 hours.

I commissioned one of the players to create a custom wedding invite to act as a teaser for the upcoming game, seen in the header.
