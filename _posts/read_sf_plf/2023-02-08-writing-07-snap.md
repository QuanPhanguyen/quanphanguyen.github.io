> My first creative story since starting college. Rough around the edges, but full of heart.

The chill of the coast prickled the back of my neck. I sat, shivering, on the steel-lined bench as my girlfriend perched upright with hands overlapped. Nestled in between her warm grip was a Nikon D810, pointed ahead at the sharp, sun-blazed bay.

I tried to sneak a gloved hand into Kayla’s pocket, searching for a respite from the sheer cold. She perked up upon feeling my intrusion and turned to me with a smile. Her hand moved off of her lap to grab ahold of mine.

“Cold?”

“No, I’m burning up here.”

Kayla gave a small chuckle at my poor joke. She held my hand harder. 

“Just a little longer. Once the shadow of that tree falls onto that rock, I’ll take the picture and we’ll head on out. Promise.”

I wasn’t actually against staying here, despite the creeping advances of the cold. Bundled up, sitting with my head leaning on her shoulder, I couldn’t think of anything I’d rather be doing. 

I glanced at her and saw her bare hand still firmly clasped onto the strap of the camera. A thought crossed my mind.

“Kayla. How come you never take any pictures of me?”

She was a bit surprised at my conjecture.

“You never ask.”

“Well, that hasn’t stopped you before. I’m asking now.” I struck a pose.

She laughed, then hesitated. “No.”

My eyebrows rose partly in shock, partly in confusion, as I dropped my act.

“Why not?”

“Well, I just don’t take pictures of people, you know,”  She said, slowly. 

“Shut up, I see you take candids all the time. Your friends, family, heck, you’ve even taken pictures of my parents. You’ve literally shown me. C’mon. Why not me?”

She moved her hand off her camera to place them on her eyes, deflecting them away from me. 

“You’re gonna think the reason is stupid.”

I didn’t say anything back because, quite honestly, I could and would think that.

“I just don’t think any of the pictures I’ve taken of you have been good enough.” She spoke, quietly.

“That’s a dumbass reason.” I was dumbfounded. “Are you cheating on me?”

“What?” Kayla said, startled.

“Well, that’s the only reason I can think of why someone would be so against taking their girlfriend’s pictures.” I joked. 

“No I swear, Jen, I just don’t think I’m good enou-” 

I stood up and walked over to the rock, standing directly in front of it. 

“Jen, what are you doing?”

“You’re gonna have to take my picture now!” I shouted, attempting to make myself heard over the winds of the shore. The shadow on the tree next to me was steadily creeping onto the stone. Kayla sat at the bench, expression saying Are you actually going to do this? 

I most certainly was.

Exasperated, Kayla brought her camera to a still for a series of shots. Once she put it down, she gestured to me.

“C’mon, get back over here! You’re going to freeze to death!” 

I happily obliged, taking my rightful seat by her side. I looked at her camera, taking in the shot. The softly glowing coast lit up its backdrop, with me included! “So how is it? Great, right?” 

“Well, you ruined the composition. Your skirt color messes with the scenery. And you weren’t standing in the right spot for a portrait either.”

She turned to me with a serious expression on her face. I looked away, pursing my lips. Then, she leaned in for a quick peck on the cheek before grinning.

“I think it’s my best photo yet.”
