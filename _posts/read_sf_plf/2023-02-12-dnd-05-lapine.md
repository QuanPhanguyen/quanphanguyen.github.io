> Can an ordinary village girl win the heart of the crown princess?

***As an infamous adventuring group known for failing even the most basic of requests, work has been quite slow as of late. You haven't received a commission from the guild for nearly two months and your savings are quickly dwindling.***

***Yesterday, you received a job listing specifically meant for your party. It offers a measly reward of 10 silver pieces, but you'll take what you can get. The goal in question? To help the commoner Lapine Bassont enter a relationship with the crown princess of the city, Alice Duvaal.***

I worked on this idea during class thinking about my lonely Valentine's. Everyone should suffer as I do so this one-shot isn't about getting their character's into relationships, it's about getting a charming, naive NPC into one. Run with experienced players, but is extremely beginner friendly. Entirely ran in-person, but online is possible. Silly, full of hijinx, and contains a touch of angst. Roleplay heavy.
