> An empire's mission reveals a ghastly shipwreck.

***The four of you are arms for hire, usually employed by the government to clear out any obstacles near the border of the Hallon Empire walls. You’ve been hired to retrieve a certain journal from a shipwreck near the Silini province, a coastal town. Now you’re sitting on the deck of a small sea faring boat, making your way far into the ocean. An older human male steers the ship, a pipe in his mouth. As you’re all seated, feeling the gentle ocean breeze on the back of your neck and basking in the flight of swirling blue, I’d like you all to describe what your character looks like to each other.***

This one-shot was created in one day, solely meant to explore the mechanic of underwater combat. Only three players were able to make it to this one, causing it to end well before the third hour. It's one of the shortest one-shots I've designed, although it mimics WotC modules the closest. Exploration focused. 

Credits to the Om campaign for their boat asset.
