> Can an ordinary village girl win the heart of the crown princess?

I worked on this idea during class thinking about my lonely Valentine's. Everyone should suffer as I do so this one-shot isn't about getting their character's into relationships, it's about getting a charming, naive NPC into one. Run with experienced players, but is extremely beginner friendly. Entirely ran in-person, but online is possible. Silly, full of hijinx, and contains a touch of angst. Roleplay heavy.
