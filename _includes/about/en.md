My name is Quan Phanguyen. 

I've been inking down stories since I was nine years old. My first publication arrived in the form of a Minecraft fanfiction posted on Wattpad, and it was soon followed in the next year by a realm-bending tale of me and my friends with elements suspiciously akin to a children's novel dealing with a feline, an arcanist, and a closet. 

I play piano, I write fan fiction, I practice stenography, I do digital art, traditional art, all sorts of other types of art, I make edits to songs I enjoy with clips of videos I feel strongly about, I have a Youtube channel that's more like an archive of moments I remember fondly, and I host games like Dungeons and Dragons, scavenger hunts, or contests/quizzes/challenges to bring some joy into my friend's sad lives. Where would they be without me.

I write, too. 

UC Berkeley graciously bestowed upon me a B.A in English in 2024. I additionally completed a Minor in Creative Writing while serving as an Editor for Berkeley's student-run publication journal, Berkeley Fiction Review. 

My goals for the future are to be a published author and to be involved in the storytelling process of tabletop or video games. It would be a dream to be part of a published D&D campaign module or an indie or Triple-A game.

<!-- Hey, I am Erwin Lejeune (a.k.a. _@rangonomics_, _@wardn_). I am a Robotics Engineer by degree, but I consider myself a Software Engineer at the core and have not limited myself to Robotics and its transversal fields. I have deployed web apps for blockchain analytics, trading (don't use it) bots, investment analytics apps, web3 and many more projects.

In the past, I have led the development of Serena's Autonomous Navigation (ROS2, C++) stack at [Coalescent Mobile Robotics](https://cm-robotics.com/), worked at [Hiventive](https://www.hiventive.com/en/) both as a Back-End Software Engineer (Go, PostgreSQL) and as a Embedded Software Engineer (C++, C).

I have also been part of the Real Time Systems research team at [LS2N](https://ls2n.fr) for AI Planning, in which I have developed [pymapf](https://github.com/APLA-Toolbox/pymapf) (Multi-Agents Pathfinding Toolbox) and [pyddl](https://github.com/APLA-Toolbox/pythonpddl) (PDDL Parser/Planner).

I have interned at [Ingeniarius](https://ingeniarius.pt/), where I have worked on [STOP](http://stop.ingeniarius.pt/), [SAFE](http://safeforest.ingeniarius.pt/) and [SEMFIRE](http://semfire.ingeniarius.pt/).

I completed my BSc. in Electronics from [Nantes Université](https://english.univ-nantes.fr/), followed by a Master's in Embedded Systems at [Bordeaux Ynov Campus](https://www.ynov.com/campus/bordeaux). I then transfered for a Control and Robotics Master's at [Ecole Centrale Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/english-version), a top 5 graduate school in the country.

I now started the process of learning Blockchain Technology as well as their web integrations with web3.
